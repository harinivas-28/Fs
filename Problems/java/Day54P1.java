You are participating in a futuristic space exploration mission where you must
navigate through a series of planets aligned in a straight line.
The planets are numbered from 0 to n-1, and you start your journey on planet 0.

You are given a 0-indexed array planets, where each element planets[i]
represents the maximum number of planets you can move forward from planet i.
In simpler terms, standing on planet i, you can move to any planet from i+1 to
i+planets[i], as long as you don't exceed the last planet.

Your goal is to reach the final planet (planet n-1) in the fewest number of
moves possible.

It is guaranteed that a path to the final planet always exists.

Return the minimum number of moves needed to reach planet n-1.

Example 1
----------
Input:
2 3 1 0 4
Output:
2

Explanation:
- Move from planet 0 to planet 1.
- Move from planet 1 to planet 4 (last planet).
